# Bike-Sales Analysis
## Project-Background
Our bike sales company needed more customers to buy more bikes, so we conducted an analysis to create insights on how to get more customers to buy bikes, and also methods to improve our services.

We considered different attributes and hindrances, that could be key reasons why a lot of people did'nt buy bikes, and solutions to these problems, we looked at areas such as: Income, Marital status, Gender, Commute-distance, Region e.t.c.


Insights and consideration are provided on these key areas:
   - Income: From the analysis we found out that income rate affected the sales, we found out that people with higher income rate are the ones that buy more bikes on an average level, and people that earn lesser income tend to buy lesser amount of bikes.

   - Age: Also age brackets was also a key point indicator (KPI), the ages were categorized into three groups which are: "Adolescent" (ranging from the ages of 0-30), "Middle-Aged"(Ranging from  the ages of 31-53),and the "Old" category (which ranges from ages 54 and on.....).

   - Commute distance: The commute distance also has a large impact on the sales rate of the company, because the amount of distance people commute determine whether there will be need for any means of transportation.

## Data Types
The bike sales dataset consists of the following columns, and these are their data formats:

Prior to this analysis, a variety of checks and data cleaning was conducted on the dataset to ensure quality, and a well organized dataset.

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

After the different steps taken in this analysis in order to solve the business problem which is to find out why lesser amount of people buy bikes, and solutions to these problem. We have found out that there are different causes for the low purchases of bikes accross diffferent subjects and for different people.

Above is an interactive visualization with key point indicators (KPI's) showing the amounts of bikes sold and the comparism was split into three categories which are INCOME, COMMUTE DISTANCE and AGE BRACKETS.

## Reccomendations.

Based on the uncovered insights the following reccomendations have been provided:

![customer commute visualiztion](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4baf1bda-6bf8-46e6-89f3-3bbfdae9f197)

- Seeing that the lesser the commute distance, the higher the amount of bikes sold. Opening new branches for the company within a distance of at least 5 miles, to ensure that commute distance do not become a hinderance to sales.This will solve the problem of long distances hindering sales.

- It is obvious through the viz below, that, most of the bikes that has been sold, and it has been sold to a particular age-group which is "middle-aged". Crecating a "Purposeful" and "Targeted" advertisement to the right audeience (which in this case are other age brackets), citing the importance of buying bikes.

- From this last visualization it is obvious that most of our customers that have purchased bikes are men and it is correlating with the fact that they have a higher income rate in comparism to the female's income at an average level. But, if the company can make discounts available to the women, considering the fact that they are being paid lesser on an average level in comparism to the men, and it's a correlation to the fact that men buy more bikes and are being paid higher on an average level, and the opposite is for the women,it will increase bike sales for the company. This insights would be extra useful to a business analyst.

## Caveats and Assumption
  - In this analysis i would like to note that the data set was not all pure and perfect, they were a lot of missing and void rows in the dataset which i just had to remove and bypass as this is one of the steps in the cleaning stage of the data analytics process.
  - Also this data set had a few misplaced data, i.e in some rows, they were some mixed-up data, i just had to use my domain-knowledge in the field of business and my foundational knowledge in data analytics ethics, and it was all good.
